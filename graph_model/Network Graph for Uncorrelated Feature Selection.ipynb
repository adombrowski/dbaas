    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core assumptions underpinning many statistical models is independence among the explanatory variables. So let's assume that you want to train your models with variables that are no more than .1 correlated with any other variable in the set. Sounds easy, no?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not quite. You could manually select your variable combinations but that gets taxing quite quickly and only works when you have a low variable count. But let's say you have a modest count of 8 variables. If you choose 2 variables from 8, that's 56 unique pairings. That's simple enough: just look at a corrlation matrix and choose only the pairs below our .1 threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about groups of 3? That's 336 unique combinations (8 chooses 3 i.e. 8!/(3!(8-3)!)). Furthermore, correlation matrices are pairwise so not only do you need to find the pairs that are uncorrelated, but you need to make sure that no variable is more than .1 correlated with any of the other variables. For instance, if you have variables 1, 2, and 3 you'd need to manually check that (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3) all have correlations below .1\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's just for a feature set of 3! Doing this for 4 is way more taxing (1680 combos), 5 (6720 combos), 6 (2160 combos) and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most data scientists are working with feature sets much larger than the 8 I describe above. \n",

    "### Variance Inflation Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to check for the occurence of multicollinearity in a regression model (variable count > 2) is by calculating what's called the Variance Inflation Factor. VIF \"is calculated by taking the the ratio of the variance of all a given model's betas divide by the variance of a single beta if it were fit alone.\" [reference_here](https://etav.github.io/python/vif_factor_python.html). Simply put: VIF attempts to capture how well the rest of a model's variables explain the independent variable you isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance Inflation Factor calculations are important because they capture multi-collinearity even among variable sets that see low pairwise correlations. So in no way am I suggesting that the method I discuss below is superior/intended to replace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering Large Feature Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's assume we have 100 features and we want to experiment with different stacking strategies. In one strategy, we pool a large number of weakly trained ensemble/logit models trained on only a fraction of the feature space. In another strategy, we train a few models on a larger feature set. For both strategies we use the base model outputs as inputs to our higher level model. And also assume that we want to test the efficacy of a one-model approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have 100 features we are left with a very large number of feature combinations that we'll want our script to run through. Furthermore, running VIF analysis on dozens of variables for hundreds if not thousands of models is pretty costly. So how can we filter down the feature space to something more manageable?"

    "### Defining the Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggested at the beginning that we consider each feature set of varying sizes where all variables contained within the set are no more correlated with any other variable within the set than a stipulated threshold. For simplicity let's just say that the threshold is a correlation of .1\n",
    "\n",
    "Each set then will be comprised of these variables. So let's assume that we have three uncorrelated features: A, B, C. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (A,B), (A,C) and (B,C) all have a correlation < .1\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this case we can train our model on these three pairwise combinations and we can also train on all three variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we see that a set of size 4 can be decomposed into sets of size 3 and 2. Consider A, B, C, D:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (A, B, C), (A, B, D), (A, C, D), (B, C, D) acceptable triangles\n",
    "- (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), (C,D) acceptable pairwise\n",
    "\n",
    "And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need some way to identify all acceptable groups of varying size. For instance, when testing our strategy of training and stacking many low-dimensional models, we'll need feature sets of size 1-6. However, for training higher dimensional models we'll need to identify feature sets much larger (if they exist)."

    "### Network Graphs\n",

    "I'll close this exposition by discussing how I go about doing this and then I'll provide a walkthrough of my code. Our challenge is three-fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need to identify all lower-level feature set combinations (the decompositions of a larger set)\n",
    "2. We need to traverse a very large feature space\n",
    "3. We need to do this quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "My theory is that you can treat each set of uncorrelated variables as a complete network, meaning that each node is connected to every other node in the subnetwork. My strategy then is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify all pairs in a correlation matrix that do no exceed our threshold\n",
    "- Convert these pairwise points into a network dictionary\n",
